## Exercise 1: Computer Forensics Investigation Process

**Lab Duration:** 90 minutes

### Description

A proficient computer forensics expert should be familiar with various data recovery tools to retrieve deleted files, generate file checksums, and compare data integrity. This exercise focuses on using tools like EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, MD5 Calculator, and HashCalc to recover and verify files. 

A Computer Forensics Lab (CFL) provides a secure and controlled environment to conduct computer-based investigations. Investigators analyze evidence, including media, audio, intrusions, and other cybercrime-related data to help determine the guilt or innocence of individuals or organizations.

### Lab Tasks

1. **Recovering Data from a Windows Hard Disk**
2. **Performing Hash or HMAC Calculations**
3. **Comparing Hash Values of Files to Check Integrity**
4. **Viewing Files of Various Formats**
5. **Handling Evidence Data**
6. **Creating a Disk Image File of a Hard Disk Partition**

## Exercise 2: Identifying and Investigating an FTP Brute Force Attack Using Splunk

### Description

This exercise focuses on identifying a brute-force attack by analyzing network packets for evidence of repeated failed login attempts followed by a successful login. As a forensic investigator, understanding network-related attacks and conducting thorough analysis are essential skills.

### Lab Scenario

An attacker has attempted to take control of a target machine by brute-forcing login credentials. Your role is to examine the login patterns and determine whether the attacker has succeeded.

### Lab Objectives

- Analyze a brute-force attack using the SIEM tool Splunk.
- Identify patterns of multiple failed login attempts and subsequent successful logins.

### Tools

- [Splunk Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html)
- [EmEditor](https://www.emeditor.com/download/)
